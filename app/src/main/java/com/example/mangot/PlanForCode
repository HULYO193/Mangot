My work is all over the place so I need to  organize my work...
what to work on first and then onto the next thing:
1)create recycle view to dashboard(Only manga's name) - <3
2)create a class called "MangaStatus" that have : user name, Manga name, curr chapter, reading status( Reading , completed, dropped atc) - <3
2.5) link MangaActivity with MangaStatus and link rge spinner with MangaStatus(String status)
3)Add manga to storage
4)Add chapter under ,manga's name + all the surroundings(chapters + 1, refresh the manga's page , etc
5)Link a DashBoard to a user
6)link the Manga to the dashboard(and keep it there even when refreshed under the user)
7)
after everything is done in the code -> design the pages and I see fit
